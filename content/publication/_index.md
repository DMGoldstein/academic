- Homeric -_ph(i)n_ is an oblique case marker, _Transactions of the Philological Society_. [10.1111/1467-968X.12192](http://doi.org/10.1111/1467-968X.12192). The dataset and R code are available from [10.5281/zenodo.3592064](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3592064).

**Abstract.** The synchronic distribution and diachronic trajectory of Homeric -φι(ν) have been the source of long-standing debate, with the result that scholarly opinion has yet to settle on a consensus regarding the morphosyntax of forms realized by this marker. Some maintain that forms in -φι(ν) are adverbs, while others contend that they are nouns. Evidence from agreement and prepositional phrases shows that the latter analysis is correct. Homeric -φι(ν) is therefore a case exponent. More specifically, it is an oblique case marker that realizes genitive or dative case in the singular, dual, or plural across all three grammatical genders. Since other case markers exist in the language for realizing genitive and dative case, forms in -φι(ν) are an example of morphological overabundance, that is, the realization of a paradigm cell by more than one word form. This synchronic analysis has diachronic consequences, in as much as it now becomes clearer that -φι(ν) continues the instrumental plural case marker */-b<sup>ɦ</sup>is/ and not the adverbial suffix */-b<sup>ɦ</sup>i/.


- Indo-European phylogenetics in R: A tutorial introduction, _Indo-European Linguistics_ 8:1—71. [10.1163/22125892-20201000](http://doi.org/10.1163/22125892-20201000). The dataset and R code are available from [10.5281/zenodo.3352406](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3352406).

**Abstract.** The last twenty or so years have witnessed a dramatic increase in the use of computational methods for inferring linguistic phylogenies. Although the results of this research have been controversial, the methods themselves are an undeniable boon for historical and Indo-European linguistics, if for no other reason than that they allow the field to pursue questions that were previously intractable. After a review of the advantages and disadvantages of computational phylogenetic methods, I introduce the following methods of phylogenetic inference in R: max- imum parsimony; distance-based methods (UPGMA and neighbor joining); and maximum likelihood estimation. I discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each of these methods and in addition explicate various measures associated with phylogenetic estimation, including homo- plasy indices and bootstrapping. Phylogenetic inference is carried out on the Indo-European dataset compiled by Don Ringe and Ann Taylor, which includes phonological, morphological, and lexical characters.

- Language change and linguistic theory: The case of archaic Indo-European conjunction, _Transactions of the Philological Society_ 117:1—34. [10.1111/1467-968X.12139](https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-968X.12139).

**Abstract.** Many archaic Indo‐European languages exhibit a system of dual conjunction in which they possess both a head‐initial exponent (e.g., Latin _et_) and an enclitic exponent (e.g., Latin ⸗_que_). Mitrović (2014) and Mitrović & Sauerland (2016) argue that these two types of conjunctions instantiate the universal lexical categories J and μ. Several syntactic, semantic, and morphological properties are argued to result from this categorial distinction. For instance, J conjunctions are claimed to lack additive readings (i.e., ‘too, also’). Diachronically, head‐initial conjunctions are predicted to originate from combinations of J and μ heads (Mitrović & Sauerland 2016: 489). A closer look at the data reveals that neither of these predictions is borne out. The empirical motivation for the J/μ distinction is in fact paltry. I therefore offer a new history of Indo‐European conjunction, in which I demonstrate first that the earliest attested Indo‐European languages do not have this double system of conjunction. It is rather an innovation that resulted from the recruitment of new conjunctions across the family. These new conjunctions developed primarily from additive focus operators, and not from combinations of J and μ heads. Empirical issues aside, the analysis of Mitrović (2014) and Mitrović & Sauerland (2016) raises deeper questions about the relationship between linguistic theory and language change. I argue that some of the properties of natural language that Mitrović (2014) and Mitrović & Sauerland (2016) assign to Universal Grammar are better analysed as epiphenomena of language change.

- Variation versus change: Clitic distribution between Homer and Herodotus, _Indo-European Linguistics_ 4:53—97. [10.1163/22125892-00401006](https://doi.org/10.1163/22125892-00401006).

**Abstract.** Enclitic distribution in Greek (and archaic Indo-European generally) is governed by a set of generalizations known as Wackernagel’s Law, according to which enclitics occur in “second position.” As has long been known, surface exceptions to Wackernagel’s Law in Homer are uncommon, but in Herodotus are far more frequent. Wackernagel himself attributed this difference to syntactic change: in Homer a single mechanism is responsible for second-position clitic distribution, while in Herodotus the old second-position rule competes with new placement rules. Although the nature of these innovative mechanisms has never been explicated, philologists have adopted this view with apparent unanimity. The central claim of this paper is that the alleged syntactic change is an illusion. What Wackernagel and others have observed in Homer and Herodotus is a difference in usage, not grammar. Specifically, Herodotus uses constructions that yield non-canonical surface patterns (i.e., the clitic is not “second” in its clause) more often than Homer. As the same generalizations capture the distribution of clitics in both Homer and Herodotus, there is no validity to the claim that Wackernagel’s Law is weaker in the classical period than in the archaic, or that there are new distributional rules at work.

- The synchrony and diachrony of a scalar coordinator: Latin _nēdum_ 'let alone,' _Indo-European Linguistics_ 1:68—106. [10.1163/22125892-00101003](https://doi.org/10.1163/22125892-00101003).

**Abstract.** This paper investigates the amphichronic semantics and pragmatics of the scalar coordinator _nēdum_, ‘let alone.’ Synchronically, _nēdum_ must be preceded by an assertion that is stronger than all other alternative propositions in the focus domain. The distributional properties of the coordinator result directly from this semantics. Diachronically, the meaning ‘let alone’ developed from metalinguistic _nē_ ‘not’ and the aspectual adverb _dum_ ‘yet.’ _Nēdum_ further developed from ‘let alone’ to ‘not just’ following affirmative left coordinands.

[10.1353/apa.2013.0015](https://doi.org/10.1353/apa.2013.0015).

**Abstract.** This paper offers a novel reading of the Delphic oracle’s response to Croesus’s question of whether he should attack Persia (Herodotus 1), by focusing on a previously unacknowledged feature of the oracular answer: the preposing of the adjective μεγάλην. Preposing is a construction in which an element occurs before the start of the clause proper. In the oracle’s response, preposing serves a corrective function. As preposing creates surface exceptions to Wackernagel’s Law, it is only through an accurate understanding of the “Law” that we can even detect this construction. Working within a framework of (neo-)Gricean pragmatic theory, I detail the semantic and pragmatic contribution of preposing in the oracular response. More broadly speaking, I suggest that Gricean pragmatics can provide new insights into classical texts by offering a principled method for decoding implicit meaning.


- Iterated modal marking and polarity focus in ancient Greek, _Transactions of the Philological Society_ 111:1—25. [10.1111/1467-968X.12000](https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-968X.12000).

**Abstract.** The Ancient Greek particle _an_, which encodes modal and irrealis semantics, canonically occurs once per clause. In the fifth century bce, however, we find cases where two tokens (or, more rarely, three) co‐occur with the same verb. While this phenomenon has long been recognized in the handbooks, it has received only sporadic attention otherwise, and there is currently no adequate description or analysis of the phenomenon. In this paper, I provide the first detailed overview of the construction in the Attic dramatists (Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and Aristophanes) and Herodotos, and argue that it marks polarity focus. I tentatively identify a diachronic source construction as well.

**Abstract.** It is well known that the comparative method depends crucially on the phylogenetic tree of the languages being compared. For many linguistic families, including Indo-European, the true tree is unknown, however. To circumvent this issue, frequency heuristics have been devised to enable comparative reconstruction over consensus trees. These heuristics come in different forms, but perhaps the most prominent one maintains that if a linguistic state is attested in three geographically non-contiguous daughter languages and its presence in these languages is not the result of borrowing, then it can be reconstructed to the root of the tree. In this paper, I demonstrate that frequency heuristics are not only unreliable but fundamentally misguided. They should therefore be abandoned. I present a Bayesian method for inferring ancestral states that accounts for phylogenetic uncertainty by estimating the probability of a character state at unattested nodes over a set of resolved phylogenetic trees.

Doug Arnold, Miriam Butt, Berthold Crysmann, Tracy Holloway King, Stefan Müller, 297–317. Stanford: CSLI.

**Abstract**. In this paper we discuss second position clitics in ancient Greek, which show a remarkable ability to break up syntactic constituents. We argue against attempts to capture such data in terms of a mismatch between c-structure yield and surface string and instead propose to enrich c-structure by using a multiple context free grammar with explicit yield functions rather than an ordinary CFG.
