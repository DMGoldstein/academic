title: "The synchrony and diachrony of a scalar coordinator: Latin nedum 'let alone'"
authors: ["David Goldstein"]
date: "2013-01-01"
doi: "10.1163/22125892-00101003"
abstract: "This paper investigates the amphichronic semantics and pragmatics of the scalar coordinator _nﾄ電um_, `let alone'. Synchronically, nﾄ電um must be preceded by an assertion that is stronger than all other alternative propositions in the focus domain. The distributional properties of the coordinator result directly from this semantics. Diachronically, the meaning `let alone' developed from metalinguistic _nﾄ点 `not' and the aspectual adverb _dum_ `yet'. Nﾄ電um further developed from `let alone' to `not just' following affirmative left coordinands."
