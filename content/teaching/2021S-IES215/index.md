## Course description

Investigation of the syntax of the most archaic daughter languages of Indo-European as well as Proto-Indo-European itself. We will cover a few big-ticket topics in syntax (argument encoding, relativization, configurationality, second-position clitics, and conjunction) and discuss how synchronic theoretical models of syntax impact our view of syntactic change and reconstruction.
